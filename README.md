# g
yes, that's the name of it. \
`g` is a simple `git` wrapper that you can use if \
you are as lazy as me and do not want write looong \
boooooooring commands like `git commit -a -m "fuck"`.
#### why "permissive"?
`g`'s whole logic is to be "permissive" with its \
syntax so that it is fail-free, and also to be SHORT.

## get `g`
~~to get `g` you can either build it yourself or you~~ \
~~can install the AUR package `getg`.~~
_note: you still technically cannot get `g` from the AUR_ \
_because development is still ongoing and no AUR repo was_ \
_created for it at the moment, please wait a bit :)_
