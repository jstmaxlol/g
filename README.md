# g — that's a short name.
`g` is a \*permissive\* [git](https://git-scm.com/) wrapper that you can use \
if you are as lazy as me and do not want write **looong** and **boring** commands like \
`git commit -a -m "yo mama"`, or `git remote add origin git@github.com:torvalds/linux.git`

### why "permissive"?
`g`'s whole logic is to be "_permissive_" with its syntax making it \
is almost fail-free, and also **very very** forgiving with its user.
### but what does it mean _practically_?
it means that you can write commands **however you like**, ***within certain limitations***. \
for example, all of these are valid commands to say "`git commit -a -m "hi"`"
* `g c a m "hi"`
* `g com a msg "hi"`
* `g commit a`
<!-- * `g cam "hi"` // commented out because i am not unsure if i will implement this -->

## get `g`
to get `g` you can either build it yourself or you \
can install the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/getg) package `getg`.
