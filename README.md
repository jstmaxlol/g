# g — that's a short name.
`g` is a simple `git` wrapper that you can use if \
you are as lazy as me and do not want write looong \
boooooooring commands like `git commit -a -m "fuck"`.
### why "permissive"?
`g`'s whole logic is to be "permissive" with its syntax making it \
is fail-free, and also **very very** forgiving with its user.
### but what does it mean _practically_?
it means that you can write commands **however you like**, _within limitations_. \
for example, all of these are valid commands to say "`git commit -a -m "hi"`"
* `g c a m "hi"`
* `g com a msg "hi"`
<!-- * `g cam "hi"` // commented out because i am not unsure if i will implement this -->

## get `g`
to get `g` you can either build it yourself or you \
can install the AUR package `getg`.
